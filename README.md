# helloworld

A simple Java application that can be compiled into a .jar file using Maven.

To build
--------
    mvn clean package

To run
------
    java -cp target/helloworld-1.1.jar com.bhaskar-cloud.demo.helloworld.HelloWorld
    
    
Note: This is my First Repository to create a Java Build through Jenkins. I Will use the same project to build a Docker Image through a Jenkins Pipeline. I Will also use the Docker Image to deploy in Dev & QA Environment.
